* Machine Learning Programming Exercise 1 - Linear Regression

In this exercise we will implement Linear Regression and get to see how it works on data.
Linear Regression parameters (theta) are fit using Gradient descent algorithm. We also plot initial data and the data with linear regression fit. The plot of Cost function and Contour plots are also part of this exercise.
